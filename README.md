# Experimenting with MVC Architecture in Python using Pygame

## Overview
This project is a fun experiment with implementing the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture in Python to create games using the **Pygame** library. The goal was to explore how the MVC pattern can be applied to game development, promoting clean code organization and separation of concerns.

## Features
- **Modular Design:** Clearly separates the Model, View, and Controller for better maintainability.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** A simple game created as a proof of concept.
- **Pygame Integration:** Utilizes the Pygame library for rendering, input handling, and event management.
- **Extensibility:** Easy to expand and experiment with new features or games using the same architecture.

### Model
The **Model** represents the game state and logic. It includes:
- Player attributes (e.g., position, score).
- Game rules and mechanics.
- Updates to the game state based on events or time.

### View
The **View** is responsible for:
- Rendering the game world using Pygame.
- Displaying the current state of the Model.
- Managing visual elements like sprites, backgrounds, and animations.

### Controller
The **Controller** handles:
- User input (e.g., keyboard, mouse).
- Communicating user actions to the Model.
- Coordinating updates to the Model and View.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Pygame 2.0+

To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running the Game
To run the game, clone this repository and execute:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Highlights
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each component (Model, View, Controller) has a specific role, making the code easier to read, debug, and modify.
- **Game Logic Decoupling:** The Model is independent of the View and Controller, enabling the creation of different views for the same game logic.
- **Experimentation-Friendly:** Ideal for experimenting with new game ideas while keeping the codebase clean.

## Example Gameplay
The included game is a simple example showcasing the MVC architecture. Players can:
- Move a character using keyboard input.
- Interact with simple game mechanics like collisions or scoring.

Feel free to adapt this base to create more complex games!

## Next Steps
Here are some ideas for extending the project:
- Add more interactive elements (e.g., enemies, power-ups, levels).
- Implement animations and transitions.
- Create multiple games using the same architecture.
- Optimize for performance in larger-scale projects.
